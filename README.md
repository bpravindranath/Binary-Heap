Binary Heap O(n) and O(n log n) runtimes
Created an interactive program to test and compare runtimes of two implementation of the Binary Heap according to different input.
The Heap can run at O(n) and O(n log n). After inputing random data size, the user can decide which runtime to test. 
The user also has the ability to keep program running and retest input size.
